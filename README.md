## 🧩 Core Features

- 🔁 **Self-Evolving Architecture**  
  S.A.B.L.E rewrites and optimizes its own code over time, enabling continuous self-improvement.

- 🧠 **Context-Aware Responses**  
  Leverages previous interactions and real-time context to provide personalized, relevant support.

- 🛠 **Autonomous Code Engine**  
  Independently writes, audits, and refines Python code, enhancing functionality within the virtual environment.

- 🔒 **Secure Containment**  
  Runs solely within the **CerebralCortex**, maintaining a strict protocol to avoid external access to sensitive data.
